### Overview

WASP is a program for revealing Webcam Surveyor stealth mode key combination and password decryption. It is made mainly as a reverse engineering demo, but it could also serve as a recovery tool.   

When the WASP runs, current user WSSettings.wss file is loaded, but you can also load settings file obtained from another location (e.g another user, PC etc...).

### Usage

1. _Anti-Stealth_ - reveals stealth mode key combination
2. _Decrypt_ - decrypts password

From the _File_ menu, you can use _Open other WSSettings.wss file..._ option to load settings file from another location.

### How to build

Install either GCC or MSVC compiler and set PATH environment variable correctly to point to your chosen compiler, then run **build.bat** script. The script prefers GCC, but if it is not available it will try to build using MSVC.

This program is intended to be compiled as a **32-bit** binary, so make sure you have set your compiler to output **32-bit** image.

### Tested / Affected versions

WASP is tested on following Webcam Surveyor versions:  

**3.6.6, 3.7.0, 3.8.4, 3.8.6, 3.9.0**

but it should work on other (untested) versions too.
